Chat Super Cool
===============

Hey you guys! I'm learning web dev, you should learn it too. It's kinda awesome.
I learn better when I build something. So I built a chat
Why a chat? chats are awesome. Chat also means cat in French. Who doesn't like cats?

Hitherto, I have implemented it using two frameworks:

* Backbone
* Angular

Both use the same backend, which was implemented in Node.js with a PostgreSQL db.
